### Facts for `Floating Point Numbers with Basic Arithmetic` lesson:

 1. Floating point is a numeric data type that represents numeric values with decimal points, also referred to as float, double, or real number.
  
 1. Floating point numbers must have at least one digit `0-9`, a decimal point `.`, and either positive `+` or negative `-` sign, default sign is positive.  
 
 1. Floating point numbers can be written in two forms, fractional (e.g. `2.3054` or `-2.3054` ) and exponential form (e.g. `1.2e3` or `1.2E-3` ).
 
 1. Floating point values ranges between 1.7e-308 to 1.7e+308.
 
 1. It has a  limited precision of roughly 14 decimal digits and a platform dependent size and maximum value.
 
 1. Addition with floating point numbers uses `+` sign.

 1. Subtraction with floating point numbers uses `-` sign.

 1. Multiplication with floating point numbers uses `*` sign.

 1. Division with floating point numbers uses `/` sign.

 1. Basic arithmetic operations (i.e. `+` , `-` , `*` , `/` ) of negative and positive floating point numbers are possible.

 1. Basic arithmetic operations (i.e. `+` , `-` , `*` , `/` ) of the same negative or positive floating point numbers are possible.
