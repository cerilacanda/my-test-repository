FACTS:

Variables:
	- a container that holds certain value
	- holds a value of any type
	- a container that’s used to store both numeric and non-numeric information. 
	- no compile- or runtime type checking
	- are loosely-typed
	- is a named memory location that contains data and may be manipulated throughout the execution of the program. 
	- variables can be declared and assigned values simultaneously
	- is a container for holding information in the computer’s memory. 
	- Common punctuation characters, such as commas, quotation marks, or periods, 
		are not permitted in variable names; neither are spaces.
	- an assignment operator (=) is use to assign a value to a variable.
 NOTE: Good programming practice dictates that all variables should be declared prior to use, 
		preferably with an accompanying comment. 

Naming Rules:
	- must preceeded/begin with a dollar sign($)
	- The first character after the dollar sign must be a letter or an underscore 
	- remaining characters in the name may be letters, numbers, or underscores without a fixed limit
	- must be descriptive, make sure variable names describes the kind of information they contain
	- use an appropriate length(variable names longer than 30 characters are somewhat impractical)
	- Don't use spaces , whitespaces not allowed
	- Don't use symbols -Except underscore (_)
	- names are case sensitive

Declaring and Initializing Variables:	
	- When you declare a variable in PHP, it ’ s good practice to assign a value to it at the same time. 	
	
	***Operators are symbols that tell the PHP processor to perform certain actions. For example, the addition (+) symbol is an operator that tells PHP to add two variables or values, while the greater-than (>) symbol is an operator that tells PHP to compare two values.
