###Facts for `Strings` lesson:
 
 1. A String is a simple data type.
 
 1. Strings are a collection of characters that can have any text (i.e. letters, numbers, special characters and arithmetic values or combination of all) within single quotation marks `''` or double quotation marks `""` without any limits on length.
 
 1. Literal strings surrounded by single quotes returns exactly the value of what was inside the quotes. While, values inside double quotes get expanded, meaning it replaces variables with their values before they are used.
 
 1. A single-quoted string only recognizes `\\` to get a literal backslash and `\'` to get a literal single quote.
 
 1. An assignment operator `=` is used to assign a string literals to a variable wherein literals must be within single or double quotes. e.g. `$myString = 'I love PHP!'`
 
 1. The concatenation operator `.` and the concatenation assignment operator `.=` can be used to combine two or more strings.
 
 1. Using double quote `""` inside double quoted string are not allowed (e.g.` "I "love" PHP!"`).
 
 1. Whitespaces in between lines are ignored. 
 
 1. String interpolation is the process of evaluating a string literal containing in one or more string variables, returning a result in which the string variables are replaced with their corresponding values.
