3. Strings can be of any length
4. Strings must be quoted using matching single quotes or double quotes
5. Literal strings are surrounded by single quotes and their values are exactly what was inside the quotes.
6. Values inside double quotes get expanded, meaning that whats inside the quotes gets modified before they are used.
