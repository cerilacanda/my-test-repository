NEXT POSSIBLE TOPICS to be included

The next course content will be a combination of the topics being introduced in the "Introduction to PHP" course integrating one or two new concepts in the list below for the learners to have a thorough understanding of the course. For example, Lesson 1 title "A Recap: Working with PHP Basic Syntax" wherein we have to create a content that includes the idea of the previous course about php tags, echo, and variables together with the new concept like comments, dynamic setting and accessing variables, and assigning variables by reference.  

The following are the concepts that are not included in the content of the "Introduction to PHP" course which I think can be included in the next course. The topics listed here are not the actual lesson titles to be created by the writer. This will only serve as a guide in writing the content.
