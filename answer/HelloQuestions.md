 - There is a comma in between `Hello` and `world`
 - `Hello, world!` is not quoted
 - There is no semi-colon `;`
 - There is no statement terminator.

/// type=MS, answer=[2,5]

1. Executing the above code results in
 - `Hello, world!`
 - `A syntax error`
 - Nothing happens
 - Display of a greeting.
 - An error message

/// type=MS, answer=[3]

1. On which line does the syntax error occur?
 - 0
 - 1
 - 2
 - 3
 - 4

/// type=CR, answer=[tests/HelloWorld/HelloWorldCorrectHelloWorldphp]
```php
<?php
    echoo Hello, world!
?>
```
1. Correct the code so that it successfully executes and outputs Hello, world!

/// type=MS, answer=[1,2,3,5]

 - echo Hello, world;
 - "Hello, World!";

#Part 3. Programming
Instruction: Write a code that successfully executes and outputs the following strings.

/// type=CR, answer=[tests/HelloWorld/HelloWorldOutputHelloPHP.php]
```php
<?php
    //Write code here.
?>
```
1. `Hello PHP`

/// type=CR, answer=[tests/HelloWorld/HelloWorldOutputEverythingAllRight.php]
```php
<?php
    //Write code here.
?>
```
1. `Everything alright?`

/// type=CR, answer=[tests/HelloWorld/HelloWorldOutputLikeToHearIt.php]
```php
<?php
    //Write code here.
?>
```
1. `Like to hear that.`

/// type=CR, answer=[tests/HelloWorld/HelloWorldOutputLoveToProgram.php]
```php

    //Write code here.
?>
```
