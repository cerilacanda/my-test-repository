### Facts for `Creating and Accessing Array` lesson:

1. An array is a compound data type that allows multiple items of the same type to be stored and accessed using one name.

1. An array variable contains multiple items indexed by numbers or strings.

1. An array item is commonly referred to as an element. 

1. An array index refers to the location of an item in an array which can be either a number or a string.

1. Each element has an associated index (also called a key) that is used to access the element.

1. The simplest way to create a new array variable is to use the `array()` language construct. e.g. `$names = array("John","Dave","Fe");`

1. A short array syntax `[]` can also be used in creating or initializing array. e.g. `$name = ["John","Dave","Fe"];`

1. An integer index starting at `0` will automatically generate when an index is ommited.

1. Array elements can be accessed using the `array[key]` syntax. e.g. `echo $names[0];`
